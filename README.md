## :one: Introduction

This case study is the capstone project of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program. The scenario involves analyzing the trip data for a bikeshare company in Washington DC. 

The company has two general consumer segments: those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes (casual riders) and those who purchase annual memberships (annual members). The company believes its future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.

## :two: Business Task

The business task is to determine how annual members and casual riders user the company's bikeshare services differently. The company is hoping that the insights gained from analyzing its historical bike trip data will drive the design of marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
